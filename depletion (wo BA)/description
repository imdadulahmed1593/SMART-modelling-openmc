This are depletion cores.
1. ref smart core depletion (6 types of assemblies with varying B/A rods -- 2 type of fuel)
2. annular smart core depletion (6 types of assemblies with varying B/A rods -- 2 type of fuel)
3. homo thorium ( 1 type of assembly with varying amounts of Th% in the fuel )
4. hetero thorium ( 1 type of assembly -- 2 type of fuel[outside UO2, inside Th+UO2] ) ( with varying amounts of Th% in the fuel )
5. Annular homo thorium ( 1 type of assembly with varying amounts of Th% in the fuel )
6. Annular hetero thorium ( 1 type of assembly -- 2 type of fuel[outside UO2, inside Th+UO2] ) ( with varying amounts of Th% in the fuel )

for visual representation , see the Th-30 version of each type of core. (Those are verified)
